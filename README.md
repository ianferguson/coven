# coven
go based cli for coven news aggregator, inspired by and largely ported from: https://github.com/jackyliang/coven-cli

this is more of a learning exercise I used for toying with json/http/etc in go than it is an actual useful tool, and currently only supports being run with 0 args, which will print 12 quick one line summaries of articles on coven.link

For documentation, check the GoDocs:
